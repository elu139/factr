# factr
factr is an AI-powered system designed to detect sophisticated misinformation by analyzing content across multiple modalities (text, audio, and video).

Current solutions are flawed. Human-powered systems like X's Community Notes are slow and inconsistent. Meanwhile, AI tools like McAfee's deepfake detector are too simplistic, often flagging content with any AI-generated component (e.g., AI audio over real video) as entirely fake.

Our solution offers a more nuanced approach. Instead of just detecting AI generation, factr cross-references visual, audio, and textual information within a piece of content to identify logical contradictions and inconsistenciesâ€”the true hallmarks of misinformation.
